> "To provide campus wide information technology, innovations and user support to enhance the science students' learning experience at McGill University"

CTF was created in 1996 by McGill students. At the time, our inventory consisted of only three computers in Burnside basement. Now, we manage a network - called the Infopoints - of over a hundred computers and several printers, most of which are located in Burnside basement but with several remote stations as well. All of our computers are freely available for use by McGill students, with some usage restrictions placed on students not in the faculty of science, and each computer is capable of printing to at least one of our printers. In addition, students in the faculty of science receive free print credits each semester - see the [printing documentation](printing.html) for more.

We are staffed entirely by student volunteers and receive funding from the SUS 21st Century Computer Fund paid by all students in the faculty of science. If you wish to get involved, simply drop in on our meetings every {{ site.meeting_day }} at {{ site.meeting_time }}. Being a member requires attending our weekly meetings at least twice a month, following the taskforce mailing list and completing at least three office hours a week, during which you're expected to fix printers, help students and work on CTF-related projects.

CTF was created in 1996 by McGill students. At the time, our inventory consisted of only three computers in Burnside basement. Now, we manage over a hundred computers and several printers, most of which are located in Burnside basement but with several remote stations as well. All of our computers are freely available for use by McGill students, with some usage restrictions placed on students not in the faculty of science, with each computer capable of printing to at least one of our printers. In addition, students in the faculty of science receive free print credits each semester - see the [printing documentation](printing.html) for more.

We are staffed entirely by student volunteers and receive funding from the 21st century fund paid by all students in the faculty of science. If you wish to get involved, simply drop in on our meetings every MEETING_DAY at MEETING_TIME. Being a member requires attending our weekly meetings at least twice a month, following the taskforce mailing list and completing at least three office hours a week, during which you're expected to fix printers, help students and work on CTF-related projects.

subtitle: What goes here?
layout: default
lead: "Our office can be found in room 1B19 (across from the elevators), in Burnside basement. Our staff consists solely of volunteers, so although we try to keep the office staffed during our opening hours, it's possible that the office will be empty at times during and outside of opening hours, etc. Feel free to drop by if you have problems with a [computer](computer.html) or [printer](printing.html), [found a USB](lost-items.html) or just want to say hi. Please note that the computers within the office itself are reserved for use by staff."
sections:
- ["Staplers and holepunchers", "They're for you to use! We have X staplers, with a maximum capacity of Y pages, and Z holepunchers. Also a staple remover and like tape and paper clips and stuff."]
- ["Buying paper", "You can purchase paper from us at $3.75 a ream (a package of 500 pages)."]
- ["Hours", "We're officially open from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday (except breaks and holidays), during the fall and winter terms. Outside of these hours, our door has to be closed, but there's often someone in there - just knock. We hold meetings every MEETING_DAY at MEETING_TIME, so please don't come in then lol."]

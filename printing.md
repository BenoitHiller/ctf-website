layout: help
lead: "CTF operates four printers for student use in Burnside basement, one in the hallway outside room 1B19 and one in each of rooms 1B18, 1B17 and 1B16. There are also printers located in several other buildings (more on that to come). You can find more information on using the printers below. Note that this page is still under construction - please check frequently for updates."
sections:
- ["Who can print?", "Students in the faculty of science or who have opened an account with us can use the printers, and receive 1500 print credits per semester. To open an account, drop by [the office](the-office.html) with $30 (cash only)."]
- ["Quota", "Each black-and-white page costs four credits, and each credit is equivalent to one cent. If a print job causes you to exceed your quota, the job will still proceed, but you won't be able to print anything else until you've added enough credits. To purchase credits, just drop by the office with exact change for the desired amount, as we can't guarantee that we'll have change. Any quota you purchase is carried over to the next semester if unused (the 1500 free print credits provided each semester are excluded from this).

\n\nNote that that the cost of printing is four cents _per page_, meaning that printing a double-sided sheet of paper costs 8 cents."]

Who can print, who can't (+free printing)
quota - how it works, buying new quota, what happens when you run out
process of printing - where to print (which printer to select etc) - screenshots (problems with adobe etc)
the printers themselves - problems with them etc (out of paper, jamming, what you do) - problems with the job (page is cut off, double-sidedness, too light, something messed up)

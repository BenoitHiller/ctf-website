Our office usually only deals with USBs. If you've found or lost something else, please see the building porter in room X, although you can always stop by our office first if you want.

###Found a USB?

If you notice an unattened USB around one of the computers in Burnside basement, please bring it to us. We will do our best to identify and notify the USB's owner. Failing that, we'll keep the USB in our office until someone claims it.

###Lost your USB?

If you've lost your USB in one of the computer labs in Burnside and have not received an email from us confirming that we have it, it may still be in our possession. Come by the [office](office.html) and describe it to us, and we'll see if we have it. If you have received an email from us about your USB, please come by with some form of identification and we'll return it to you.

If you're on campus, the easiest way to contact us would be to drop by the [office](the-office.html), Burnside 1B19. Members have office hours from 9 a.m.&ndash;5 p.m. during the week, and are often there late into the night and on weekends. You can also send an email to our mailing list at taskforce@sus.mcgill.ca or call our office at (514) 398-5843.

CTF operates over 70 computers for use by McGill students in Burnside basement, and dozens more in various remote stations. Most of the computers in Burnside are contained in the computer labs (rooms 1B16, 1B17 and 1B18), with the remaining 14 in the hallway across from the elevators. Note that this page is still under construction - please check frequently for updates.

Using the printers
------------------

See the [printing](printing.html) documentation.

Who can use them?
-----------------

Students in the faculty of science can log in using their McGill email and password, because they pay the SUS 21st century fund. Out-of-faculty students (this includes students in Nursing, Agricultural Sciences, and Kinesiology) can open an account with us for $30 (includes 1500 [print credits](printing.html)); otherwise, they will be able to log in but won't have access to the Internet. Note that the $30 fee for out-of-faculty students must be repaid every semester.

Changing your password
----------------------

You can change your password by accessing your personal menu in [Minerva](https://banweb.mcgill.ca). Note that this will change your password for most other McGill services as well. If you've tried to log onto a computer with the wrong password several times and have been locked out, you'll have to visit ICS on the first floor of Burnside, room 112. They're open Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.

Storage space
-------------

All of our computers provide access to three shared network drives on which students can save personal documents: the P drive, the W drive, and the I drive. Students get 100 MB of disk space on the P drive (provided by McGill) and 150 MB on the I and W drives combined (provided by CTF). If you run out of storage space, you may find programs starting to behave erratically; in that case, you should try deleting old or unused files.

Installed programs

Computer lab rules
------------------

No food or drinks are allowed in the computer labs. Offenders will find themselves locked out of CTF computers for a week. Other than that, there are no real rules; just be courteous to other students in the labs and be careful with the equipment.

Computer lab hours
------------------

Students in the Faculty of Science have 24/7 card access to the computer labs in Burnside, as well as to the building as a whole. For out-of-faculty students, the computer labs are only unlocked between 9am and 5pm. Students with no card access will only be able to access the computer labs between those times, and can only enter the building between 6am and 9pm, unless, of course, accompanied by a student who does have card access.{% comment %} not sure {% endcomment %}

Computer problems
-----------------

If you're having problems with your computer, come by the office and we'll try to send someone to take a look at it for you. If you're at a remote station, you can send us an email describing your problem.

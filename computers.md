title: Computers
layout: help
lead: "CTF operates over 70 computers for use by McGill students in Burnside basement, and dozens more in various remote stations. Most of the computers in Burnside are contained in the computer labs (rooms 1B16, 1B17 and 1B18), with the remaining 14 in the hallway across from the elevators. Note that this page is still under construction - please check frequently for updates."
sections:
- ["Using the printers", "See the [printing](printing.html) documentation."]
- ["Who can use them?", "Students in the faculty of science can log in using their McGill email and password, because they've paid the 21st century fund. Students not in the faculty of science can open an account with us for $30 (includes 1500 [print credits](printing.html)); otherwise, they will be able to log in but won't have access to the Internet."]
- ["Changing your password", "You can change your password by accessing your personal menu in [Minerva](https://banweb.mcgill.ca). Note that this will change your password for most other McGill services as well. If you've tried to log onto a computer with the wrong password several times and have been locked out, you'll have to visit ICS on the first floor of Burnside, room 112. They're open Monday to Friday, 9 to 5."]
- ["Storage space", "**Section under construction**

\n\nInformation about disk quota and where files are stored."]
- ["Installed programs", "**Section under construction**

\n\nList the most commonly-used ones (with icons) and explain the policy on installing new things (you can't, run it off your USB or come by the office and we'll see if we can install it for you temporarily)."]
- ["System information", "**Section under construction**

\n\nList the operating systems used (XP, 7) and give some hardware information for each of the different generations. [Source](http://taskforce.sus.mcgill.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=107&Itemid=66) (out-of-date, but looks reliable)"]

\n\nDisplay maps of locations of computers, including remote stations."]
- ["Computer lab rules", "**Section under construction**

\n\nNo food or drinks are allowed in the computer labs. Explain lab hours and after-hours access."]
